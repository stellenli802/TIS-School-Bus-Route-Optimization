# TIS-School-Bus-Route-Optimization
This is a research project I had done in high school for Tianjin International School (TIS). The goal of this project was to minimize the travel times of the school busses at TIS to avoid students getting to classes late in the morning. Since the school is located in a metropolitan area, this is a significant issue at times when traffic is bad. 
I started by collecting the school's current traveling information through AMap's real-time API. Then, I used the School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP) model to compute a route that accomplishes my goal. Lastly, by manually adjusting the routes, not only was I able to reduce travel times by an average of 6.3 minutes, but I was also able to reduce the number of busses needed by one bus, which also significantly reduces the cost of operations for TIS's school bus system.
